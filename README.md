End of Sprint 1:

By the end of Sprint 1, we had completed the database schema and planned the tasks for the remainder of the project. As for the application itself, we created the model structures and implemented a system with three user roles. However, no additional functionalities were developed at this stage.

-----
End of Sprint 2:

At this stage, the application included the following functionalities:
	•	Administrators and editors can add and delete products without restrictions.
	•	Administrators can add and delete categories.
	•	Administrators can edit any product or category, while editors can only modify their own entries.
	•	Administrators and editors can create posts for products in the database.
	•	Posts can have comments, which can be created or edited by anyone.
	•	Posts display a price and a rating set by the creator.

End of Sprint 3:

The following features were added:
	•	Posts are displayed with pagination.
	•	A search engine was implemented for posts, allowing sorting based on multiple criteria.
	•	When editors create a post or add a new product, it must be approved by an administrator.
	•	When editors edit a product or post, the modifications require administrator approval to be applied.
	•	The rating is now calculated based on user comments, with a scoring system from 1 to 5.

End of Sprint 4:

The project gained its final structure and design, with the following additions:
	•	The admin can edit and delete posts, products, and comments.
	•	The admin has a dedicated page to view all editors, revoke permissions, and create new editors.
	•	Users can add products to their cart and place orders.
	•	Product information is now well-structured across the index page, individual product pages, and the cart.

------
In the final days, we focused on improving the aesthetic aspect of the application. A well-designed interface is crucial, even though visual preferences are subjective. Additionally, we populated the database with various entries, including categories, products, posts, and users with different roles.

Conclusion:

This project was both challenging and rewarding, pushing us to be creative while strengthening our teamwork skills. We gained a deeper understanding of well-structured web design that enhances user experience and learned how to implement functionalities we often take for granted.

Trello helped us establish an efficient team workflow by organizing tasks into cards and setting clear deadlines. The satisfaction of delivering a fully functional and user-friendly product is immense, and this experience has given us valuable insights into building real-world web applications.
